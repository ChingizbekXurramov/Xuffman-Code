Cryptography is the process of hiding or coding information. Only the person to whom a was intended for can read and process the information.
The art of cryptography is used in bank cards, computer passwords, and ecommerce.
Modern cryptography techniques include algorithms and ciphers. They are used to encrypt and decrypt information.
Cryptography provides 4 security services: 1) confidentiality 2) data integrity; 3) authentication; and 4) non-repudiation.
There are two cryptosystems: 1) Symmetric-in this system only one key is used to encrypt and decrypt information 2) Asymmetric -in this system two keys are used: public key to encrypt information and private key to decrypt information.
Cryptography is important to make communication and information secure in transit and to prevent it from being read by untrusted parties.
